### About This Project

This project is intended for use by the McGuire Center of Lepidoptera and Biodiversity (MGCL) at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH). As such, by default, the
application is only compatible with institutions having identical, MySQL database schemes. It is possible to adapt this software to another isntitution's requirements,
however the more closely structured to MGCL's configuration the more seamless the conversion. For more information regarding the structures neccessary for adopting this software,
please contact the <a href='https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/kawahara-lab/contact/' target='_blank'>Kawahara Lab</a> directly.
