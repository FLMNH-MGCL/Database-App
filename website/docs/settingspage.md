The settings page has only a few configurable options available: notification settings, theme toggle, and the Database Credential configuration.

## Notifications

There are auditory notifications for the more important notifications, those requiring more attention. You do, however, have the option to mute these sounds.

## Theme

By default, the theme is determined based on your preferred theme in your browser, however you may toggle between light and dark by using the Radio form input.

## Database Access Credentials

To update the credentials, you would hit 'Update Config' and upload the provided JSON file. If you are missing this JSON file, please contact the database manager directly to request access.

Once you update the Database credentials, the application will require a reset. You may use the toolbar for this: `File > Reset`
