The settings page has only a few configurable options available: notification settings, theme toggle, and the Database Credential configuration.

## Notifications

There are auditory notifications for the more important notifications, those requiring more attention. You do, however, have the option to mute these sounds.

## Theme

By default, the theme is determined based on your preferred theme in your browser, however you may toggle between light and dark by using the Radio form input.

## Database Access Credentials

This is deprecated. Please ignore it, the documentation photo will be updated to reflect this shortly.
